William Henry Gates is an American business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and humanitarian. He is best known as the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation. Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution.

He studied at Harvard University after scoring 1590/1600 at SAT. In his second year, Gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years. His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou. On November 1975, he found Microsoft and never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.
