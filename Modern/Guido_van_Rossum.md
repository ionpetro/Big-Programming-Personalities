Dutch programmer best known as the author of the Python Programming Language (open source). He was a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) until he stepped down in July 2018. In December 1989, he had been looking for a hobby during Christmas, so he decided to write an interpreter for a new scripting language. He chose the name Python since he was a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Today, python is the second most popular language on GitHub and amongst the top 10 most mentioned languages on job postings.
