# LINUS TORVALDS

![alt text](../images/linus.png)

Finland software engineer, the creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel. Created the distributed version control system of Git. Torvalds wanted to buy a UNIX system. Luckily for us, he didnâ€™t have enough money. So, he decided to make his own clone of UNIX, from scratch. Linus Torvalds has a strong dislike for C++ programming language. He has been vocal about it. He jokes that Linux Kernel compiles faster than a C++ program. Got married to his wife, when she sent him an email for a university project (yes, he was her professor).
