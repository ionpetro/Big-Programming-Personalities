Page is the inventor of PageRank, a well-known search ranking algorithm for Google. In his PhD studies, he focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page. Soon Sergey Brin, a fellow Stanford PhD student, would soon join Page's research project. Some years later, Brin and Page incorporated Google, Inc. The pair's mission was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful" .
